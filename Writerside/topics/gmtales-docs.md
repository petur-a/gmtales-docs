# Introduction

Welcome to the GMTales documentation. Herein is contained full documentation for how to write articles as well as navigational help with the website.

## Motivation

There are many campaign management tools. Probably because it is fun to write one, I should know. I wrote one because I wanted something very specific. I was struggling with the following aspects:

* Creating content should be easy as possible. And then some.
* I want to write on my own machine. Wih the dumbest text editor if need be.
* I want to synchronize this work to some repository for public consumption.

## Main philosophy

My motivations led me to the following characteristics I want from my management tool:

* The medium should be 100% text based. Which includes text enrichment and any sort of extra structure. 
* As much work as possible to be done for the creators. 
* An API which I can use to control my work outside the confines of a webpage.

Anyway, if this tool already exists, do tell. Or don't, the sunk cost fallacy may be too much to handle. Check out the documentation either way if this has sparked your curiosity. Too-de-loo!
